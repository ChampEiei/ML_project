## Overview

I am a **Data Analyst | Business Intelligence** professional with a background in accounting, IT, and data literacy. My portfolio showcases:
- **Flight Price Prediction** with a scikit-learn pipeline
- **GDP Forecasting** with deep learning techniques
- **Capstone Final Year Project** analyzing revenue, expenses, and customer segmentation

The web app is built using **Flask** and **Bootstrap** for a responsive design, and includes interactive charts using **Plotly**. For in-depth data exploration and pipeline details, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebook` folder.
